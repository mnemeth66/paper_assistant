1. New methodological improvements for protein engineering.
   - Relevant: papers that discuss new machine learning models, assay and screen design specifically for improvement of protein engineering methods.
   - Not relevant: papers that are just applying old methodologies, unless the biological problem is very interesting.

2. Novel ways to design or use machine learning or AI for biological modeling.
   - Relevant: new problems where machine learning models can be used to substantially improve prediction. New ML architecture design for biology. Creative new uses of ML in biological problems or workflows.
   - Not relevant: marginal improvements just from applying the newest ML architecture to an already heavily modeled problem.

3. New synthetic biology technologies
   - Relevant: new technologies that creatively use existing biotechnologies, and offer rich discussions of what new applications are enabled by it.
   - Not relevant: 

4. Gene Editing, Immunology, Drug Discovery, Gene Delivery
   - Relevant: any new papers in the following contexts
