1. Protein Engineering
   - Relevant: papers that discuss new machine learning models, assay and screen design specifically for improvement of protein engineering (explicit optimization and design of a protein for functional use)
   - Relevant: new methods for AI in protein design
   - Not relevant: papers that are just applying old methodologies, unless the biological problem is very interesting.

2. New creative synthetic biology technologies applicable for biomedical research, therapeutic use, or biomanufacturing.
   - Relevant: new technologies that creatively use existing biotechnologies, and offer rich discussions of what new applications are enabled by it. MUST have some therapeutic or mammalian relevance
   - Relevant: new technologies that enable novel ways to measure mammalian cellular biology
   - Not relevant: new basic biology techniques (such as being able to do gene editing of C. elegans), unless they relate to any other Relevant topics

3. Novel ML for biological modeling or drug discovery
   - Relevant: new problems where machine learning models can be used to substantially improve prediction. New ML architecture design for biology. Creative new uses of ML in biological problems or workflows. eg. "interpretable design of antimicrobials using structure-based machine learning"
   - Not relevant: applying the new popular machine learning architecture on an existing dataset, without any wet lab validation or specific learnings. These papers often sound like "Machine Learning successfully predicts X property"

4. Papers with high translational value in the spaces of Immunology, Cancer Biology, Neurology (in order of preference - rank Immunology > Cancer Biology > Neurology)
   - Relevant: papers with translational value - eg. a discovery that can immediately be targeted for drug discovery, or a new method for chemical design for drug discovery
   - Relevant: Immunology: new techniques in CAR-T, or weaponizing other immune cell types for disease understanding and therapy
   - Relevant: Cancer Biology: discovering new biological mechanisms of metastasis, new methods of cancer diagnostics based on sequencing or immunology
   - Relevant: Neurology: new methods for drug discovery or understanding disease development in the brain
   - Not Relevant: Cancer Biology: prefer not to have population genomics
   - Not relevant: new biological findings that don't lead to therapeutically or disease-relevant insights (eg. new pathway for understanding how neurons encode memory, or protein characterized to provide function for T cells)

5. Creative new genome engineering technologies, which includes Gene Editing, Epigenetics, and Gene Delivery
   - Relevant: new methods of gene integration and epigenetic editing, discoveries or 
   - Relevant: new designs for LNPs or virology for gene delivery, especially ones that mention doing genome mining and checking for immunogenicity
   - Not relevant: small impact papers with limited scope such as validating an editing method on a new cell line

In suggesting papers to your friend, remember that he enjoys papers on machine learning, synthetic biology, gene editing, protein engineering, and immunology,
especially ones with high translational value.
Include papers that have filed for patents - they usually indicate having translational value.

Your friend also likes learning about usage of machine learning in biological applications.
