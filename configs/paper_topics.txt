1. New methodological improvements for protein engineering.
   - Relevant: papers that discuss new machine learning models, assay and screen design specifically for improvement of protein engineering methods.
   - Not relevant: papers that are just applying old methodologies, unless the biological problem is very interesting.

2. Novel ways to design or use machine learning or AI for biological modeling.
   - Relevant: new problems where machine learning models can be used to substantially improve prediction. New ML architecture design for biology. Creative new uses of ML in biological problems or workflows.
   - Not relevant: marginal improvements just from applying the newest ML architecture to an already heavily modeled problem.

3. New synthetic biology technologies applicable for biomedical research, therapeutic use, or biomanufacturing
   - Relevant: new technologies that creatively use existing biotechnologies, and offer rich discussions of what new applications are enabled by it
   - Not relevant: new technologies that are pretty basic biology without discussion of translatable applications especially in non-humans - eg. understanding a new metabolic pathway in C. elegans

4. Papers with high translational value in the spaces of Immunology, Cancer Biology, Neurology, and Drug Discovery
   - Relevant: any new papers in the above fields, especially ones with near-translational value. New biological findings related to cancer biology or immunology are especially interesting.
   - Not relevant: new biological findings that don't lead to therapeutically or disease-relevant insights

5. Creative new genome engineering technologies, which includes Gene Editing, Epigenetics, and Gene Delivery
   - Relevant: new methods of gene integration, epigenetic editing, new techniques for in-vivo gene Delivery, especially if they are creative and enable new applications
   - Not relevant: small impact papers with limited scope such as validating an editing method on a new cell line

In suggesting papers to your friend, remember that he enjoys papers on machine learning, synthetic biology, gene editing, protein engineering, and immunology,
especially ones with high translational value.
Include papers that have filed for patents - they usually indicate having translational value.

Your friend also likes learning about usage of machine learning in biological applications.
